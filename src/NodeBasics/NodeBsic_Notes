every node based project by default searches for an file name = server.js
if the file is present then there is n start required in package.json file
when we run -> npm start without start command in scripts of package.json 
then by default node will take this server.js file as input and executes

but if start is not present and no file like server.js then it will throw error

except server.js if you want you custome file to run the  use start script like
"start" : "node test.js"
   then npm start to run file test.js
   
in this scenario no use main parameter in package.json file
