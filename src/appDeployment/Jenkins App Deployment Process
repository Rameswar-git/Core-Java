create virtual machine with cent os (this is simillar with an instance in aws where instance os is cent os)
then  install docker
then from virtual box cent os comand prompt using docker commands pull jekins image from docker hub -> then the run the jenkin image our jenkins will up and running as docker container . access it by using docker container port

generally how jenkins deploy docker based app to remote machine
------------------------------------------------------------------
using previous jenkins docker container 
 jenkins will execute the docker compose file of the abc application and create an image out of it
 then jenkins will push that image to docker hub or docker.fmr.com and  (this usally happens in publich.sh file)
 then to deploy the pushed image to an remote instance jenkins will execute an script like deploy.sh
                      where it will either copy the deploy.sh file from jenkins machine(container) to romote machine(container) or if the file deploy.sh already
					   exists then jenkins will execute deploy.sh in the remote machine from jenkins machine itself by loging into the remot machine using ssh and execute deploy.sh file there
					     the after excuting the deploy.sh file in remote machine it will pull the image pushed in previous step and run it
						 this way app is deployed to an remot machine using jenkins
